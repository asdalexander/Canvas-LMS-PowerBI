# Power-BI-Canvas-LMS

This repository houses a Power BI report purpose-built for teachers and educators who utilize the Canvas LMS. The report provides an intuitive, interactive means to visualize and understand student grades across different assignments and courses, helping you to monitor student performance with ease.

## Power BI Report for Instructors Using Canvas

The Power BI report included in this repo is structured to work seamlessly with data exported from Canvas LMS. It offers a comprehensive view of student grade trends segmented by various parameters such as assignment, assignment type, and course.

The sample data showcased in the report mirror the structure of data obtained via Canvas's grade export feature. They are arbitrarily generated and serve to demonstrate the report's capabilities.

### Using Your Data

To render the report with your data, follow the steps below:

1. Export the grade data from Canvas LMS.
2. Save the export as a .csv file.
3. Open the provided Power BI file (.pbix) with Power BI Desktop (free to download here: [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)).
4. Upload your .csv file to the Power BI file.

For an analysis of multiple courses, append an additional column to your .csv file containing the respective course numbers.

## Future Scope

As Canvas LMS is open source, there are abundant opportunities for enhancing the capabilities of this Power BI report. One such potential upgrade is the development of a Power BI data connector to Canvas LMS. This would offer a considerable advantage, especially for educational institutions operating on a Microsoft subscription. These institutions could potentially harness the advanced reporting capabilities of the Power BI professional subscription. Be sure to keep an eye on this project for future updates and enhancements.
